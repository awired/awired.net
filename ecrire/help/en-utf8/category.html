<h1>The categories</h1>

<p>To create or modify a category, you simply have to go to the 
<em>Categories</em> section and click on <em>New category</em> or on the link
of an existing category, depending on whether you want to create or modify a category.</p>

<h2>Fields</h2>

<dl>
  <dt id="title">Title</dt>
  <dd>The name of the category. On the default model, the title is displayed in
  menu and also for each entry. This field is required.</dd>
  
  <dt id="title_url">URLed title</dt>
  <dd>The URLed title is the "URLish" form of title. Accents and
  disturbing characters for URL are deleted. The DC Engine can build it
  except if you determine a specific one. You can click the "Use" link
  to fill the field according to your category's title.
  Note that if the category's title is made of non latin characters, you
  you must specify a title of your choice. Titles made of 4 figures or more
  are invalid. In order to be valid they must be accompanied by letters. By
  example, <em>2005</em> will be invalid while <em>year2005</em> will be
  perfectly valid.</dd>
  
  <dt id="description">Description</dt>
  <dd>Description of the category, in XHTML format. This optional field allows you
  to give a detailed description of the category.</dd>
