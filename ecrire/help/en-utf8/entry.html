  an entry, with minimal training. On another hand HTML format gives you
  a complete scope for the format of your writings.</dd>

  for this entry.</dd>

  refering to your entry, or its subject. This field allows to define
  if you authorize or not trackbacks.</dd>
  
  <dt id="language">Language</dt>
  <dd>The language code for your entry. By default, it's your own language code.
