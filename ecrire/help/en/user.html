  <h1>Preferences and user management</h1>
  
  <p>To modify your preferences, click on the "Preferences" tab.
  To create or modify a user, choose the "Editors" tab.
  You must have administrator privileges for this last action.</p>
  
  <h2>Fields</h2>

  <dt id="user_pseudo">Nickname</dt>
  <dd>The user's nickname is optional.</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <p>Note: <em>If the user doesn't provide his nickname, his
  name and eventually his first name will be used to indicate who is

  instead.</em></p>
  
  <dl>
  <dt id="user_email">Email</dt>

  activate email notification for your entries' comments, then you
  must fill this field.</dd>
  
  <dt id="user_pwd">Password</dt>
  <dd>Choose a long enough password and rather cryptic. In case of updating
  user settings or preferences, leave this field empty in order to avoid
  changing your password.</dd>
  
  <dt id="user_lang">Language<dt>
  <dd>If the language exists in the translation files, it will be used
  for the user's private area. Each created entry will be
  automatically "tagged" with the same language code.</dd>
  
  <dt id="user_post_format">Prefered edit format</dt>
  <dd>Selected format will be the default one for each new entry.
  User can of course change the mode punctually for a specific entry.</dd>

  time</dt>

  between the two zones.</dd>

	 entries, he can read other entries, and create categories.</li>
